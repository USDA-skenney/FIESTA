The R package, FIESTA (Forest Inventory ESTimation and Analysis) is a research estimation tool for analysts that work with sample-based inventory data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program to accommodate: unique population boundaries, different evaluation time periods, customized stratification schemes, non-standard variance equations, integration of multi-scale remotely-sensed data and other ancillary information, and interaction with other modeling and estimation tools from CRAN R's library of packages. The FIESTA package contains a collection of functions that can access FIA databases, summarize and compile plot and spatial data, and generate estimates with associated sampling errors. Check Wiki for installation instructions.
